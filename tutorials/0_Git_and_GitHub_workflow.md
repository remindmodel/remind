# 1 Introduction

REMIND and related R packages are published as open-source software on GitHub. 
There are various workflows, how to use GitHub for collaborative
software development. We want to give some general remarks on our
prefered one. Note the following:

  - **Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system
    designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
    speed and efficiency (from: <https://git-scm.com/> - very good help,
    documentation, tutorial page for git).

  - **GitHub** is an US American company (owned by Microsoft) that provides
    hosting for software development version control using Git. (GitLab,
    SourceForge and various more are open-source alternatives to
    GitHub.)
    

### Learning objectives

The goal of this exercise is to set up REMIND for collaborative working.
After completion of this exercise, you'll be able to:

1.  "Fork" and "clone" your personal REMIND repository
2.  Keep your personal repository up-to-date with the REMIND main repository
3.  Understand the basic workflow including pull requests and branches.
4.  Have heard some very basic git commands and know where to find more help.
    
# 2 GitHub workflow

## 2.1 Fork (on the GitHub server)

Every code development (even bugfixes) will be merged into our main (called "upstream")
repository under <https://github.com/remindmodel/remind> with the help
of so called pull requests. Pull requests give us control over the
changes entering our branches. To create a pull request, we use personal
or institutional forks. They have to be kept up-to-date with our
upstream repository (the original remindmodel fork).

> **Exercise**: Visit us on <https://github.com/remindmodel/remind> and
> create your own fork by clicking at 'fork' (at the upper right).

## 2.2 Clone (download your personal repository)

It is basically possible to change the code just using the GitHub
interface, but since you want to test and run your code locally you have
to clone the repository from your fork anyway. This can be done using
the 'https' or 'ssh' address of your fork together with the `git clone`
command (cmd/bash/GUI) at your machine. We recommend to upload an
ssh-key and use ssh to connect to GitHub. Under Windows open a git bash as follows: 
open the file explorer, right-click on the folder you want to execute the git commands in
and choose "Git Bash Here" from the context menu. You need to have git installed.

> **Exercise**: Visit your fork and clone the repository at your
> machine.

## 2.3 Push (to your personal repository)

When you start making your first changes to the code at your local copy,
we strongly recommend to read a tutorial to get familiar with the basic
commands in Git. We have compiled a typical workflow at the end of this tutorial (section 3) (you can also have a look on 'git cheat sheets' like
<https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf>).

After you have added your changes locally, push (upload) them to your personal remote repository.

## 2.4 Pull (updates from the upstream repository)

To keep your fork up-to-date with the upstream repository you can use
the GitHub interface. Via `Compare` you are able to check, if the
upstream is some commits ahead. If so merge these new changes into
your fork.

<img src="figures/git-4-pull-upstream.PNG" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You can also do this merging procedure in your local copy by adding 
both your fork and the upstream repository as so called 'remotes' to 
your local repository.

> **Exercise**: Check, if there is anything to merge from the upstream
> repository into your fork. If so, merge it into the local clone of your 
> personal fork.

## 2.5 Pull request

After you have committed your changes locally, merged the latest updates from the remote upstream repository and 
pushed the result to your remote personal repository it is time to get it integrated
into the remote upstream repository. Instead of pushing them directly into the remote upstream repository we use so called
pull requests. Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by you and accepted or rejected by a 
repository collaborator. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.

**Note:** it is rather useful to do your work on feature branches rather than on the default `develop` branch. This
helps you keep better track of your work and also helps your colleagues understand easier what your recent pull request
was about. So naming your branch "bugfix_make_feature_XX_operational_again" will greatly help. See below for more on 
working with branches.
