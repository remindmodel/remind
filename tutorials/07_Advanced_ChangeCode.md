Advanced: Change REMIND GAMS Code
================
Florian Humpen√∂der (<humpenoeder@pik-potsdam.de>), Lavinia Baumstark (<baumstark@pik-potsdam.de>)


Technical Structure
=====================
The REMIND-code is structured in a modular way. The technical structure looks as follows: at the top level you find the folders `config`, `core`, `modules`, and `scripts`. The overall structure is built in the file `main.gms`. All settings and configuration information are given in the `config` folder. The `core` folder contains all files that are part of the core of the REMIND model. For each module there exists a sub-folder in the `modules` folder. Helpful scripts for e.g. starting a run or analysing results you find in the `scripts` folder.

In the `main.gms` file the technical structure of REMIND can be found. First, the `*.gms` files from the core folder are included and afterward the `*.gms` files from the activated module realization, beginning with the one with the smallest module-number. The technical structure of REMIND looks as follows:

```
SETS

DECLARATION    ---> of equations, variables, parameters, and scalars

DATAINPUT

EQUATIONS

PRELOOP        ---> initial calibration of e.g. macroeconomic model

LOOP
        ---> read gdx
----------------------------------------------- BEGIN OF NEGISH/NASH ITERATION LOOP -----
      * BOUNDS
      * PRESOLVE
      * SOLVE     ---> solve statement in module 80_optimization
      * POSTSOLVE
      
        ---> write gdx
----------------------------------------------- END OF NEGISHI/NASH ITERATATION LOOP ----

OUTPUT
```

In general, the `.gms`-files in each module realization can be the same as in the core. For each module it has to be clearly defined what kind of interfaces it has with the core part of the model.

Coding Etiquette
==================
The REMIND GAMS code follows a Coding Etiquette (found in the beginning of the file `main.gms`) Please read it before proceeding.

How to make a new module or realization in REMIND
========================================================

If you want to create a **new module** in REMIND first think about the interfaces between the core code and your new module. This helps you to design your module. 

For creating a new module you can use the function `module.skeleton` from the R package `gms`. Start R and set the working directory to the REMIND folder (e.g. `setwd("~/work/remindmodel")`). 

``` r
gms::module.skeleton(100, "bla", c("on", "off"))
```

It creates all folders and gams files for your new module `100_bla` with the realizations "on" and "off". You can find more information about the function `module_skeleton` in its documentation.

For creating a **new realization** of an existing module you can also use the R function `gms::module_skeleton`. Start R and set the working directory to the REMIND folder (e.g. `setwd("~/work/remindmodel")`).

``` r
gms::module.skeleton(100, "bla", c("on", "off", "new"))
```
It creates all additional gams files for your new realization "new" of the existing module `100_bla`. You can find more information about the function `module_skeleton` in its documentation.

After you have created all of your new files and lines for the new module or realization you have to add the description of this new feature in both the `main.gms` and in the `default.cfg` by hand.

Compiling
=============

Using the
``` 
cfg$action
```
option in `config/default.cfg` you can choose whether you want to start a run or simply check if your code compiles. By setting the option to simply `"c"` (for compile), your code will only be tested and no SLURM job will start on the cluster (helps when the cluster is full). Default value for the option is `"ce"` (for compile and execute).

You can also compile the file `main.gms` directly by running the command
```bash
gams main.gms -a=c -errmsg=1
```
or (only works on the PIK cluster, gives you highlighting of syntax errors)
```bash
gamscompile main.gms
```
This has the additional advantage of telling you in which exact file a compilation error occurred and running really fast. However, this will not take into consideration the changes you made to [`config/default.cfg`](../config/default.cfg). So if you want to test changes you made to a non-standard module realization, be sure to update the settings in [`main.gms`](../main.gms) by either editing it manually or running `./start.R -0` which resets `main.gms` to the entries of `config/default.cfg` (to get the settings of a `scenario_config*.csv`, start a single run with `start.R -i` and wait until `main.gms` is updated, then kill the run).
