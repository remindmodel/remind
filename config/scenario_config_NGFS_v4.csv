Strong policies are then needed to limit warming to below 2 K. The level of action differs across countries and regions based on currently implemented policies, leading to a fossil recovery out of the economic crisis brought about by COVID-19. The availability of CDR technologies is assumed to be low. Emissions exceed the carbon budget temporarily and decline more rapidly than in Well-below 2 K after 2030 to ensure a 67 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 2 K. This leads to considerable transition and physical risks. Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual CES nests for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production.

Climate policies are more stringent in the transportation and buildings sectors. This mimics a situation where the failure to coordinate policy stringency across sectors results in a high burden on consumers, while decarbonisation of energy supply and industry is less stringent. Emissions are in line with a climate goal giving at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5 K by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot of 1.5 K in earlier years. This leads to considerably high transition risks but rather low physical risks. Industry sectors are modeled explicitly with individual CES nests for cement, chemicals, steel, and other production.
