IMPORTANT: all costs are now given in $2015! As long as the model runs in $2005, the values need to be converted in datainput.gms
tech_stat   Technology status: how close a technology is to market readiness. Scale: 0-3, with 0 'I can go out and build a GW plant today' to 3 'Still some research necessary'.
inco0       Initial investment costs given in $(2015)/kW(output) capacity. Independent of distance.
inco0_d     Initial investment costs given in $(2015)/kW(output) capacity. Per 1000km.
constrTme   Construction time in years, needed to calculate turn-key cost premium compared to overnight costs
eta         Conversion efficieny, i.e. the amount of energy NOT lost in transportation. Independent of distance (e.g. conversion processes etc).
eta_d       Conversion efficieny, i.e. the amount of energy NOT lost in transportation. Per 1000km.
omf         Fixed operation and maintenance costs given as a fraction of investment costs inco0. Independent of distance.
omf_d       Fixed operation and maintenance costs given as a fraction of investment costs inco0_d. Per 1000km.
