*' @title REMIND - REgional Model of INvestments and Development
*'
*' @description REMIND is a global multi-regional model incorporating the economy, the climate system
*' and a detailed representation of the energy sector. It solves for an intertemporal Pareto optimum
*' in economic and energy investments in the model regions, fully accounting for interregional trade in
*' goods, energy carriers and emissions allowances. REMIND enables analyses of technology options and
*' policy proposals for climate change mitigation.
*'
*' The macro-economic core of REMIND is a Ramsey-type optimal growth model in which intertemporal global
*' welfare is optimized subject to equilibrium constraints ([02_welfare]). Intertemporal optimization
*' ([80_optimization]) with perfect foresight is subject to market clearing. The model explicitly represents
*' trade in final goods, primary energy carriers, and when certain climate policies are enabled, emissions
*' allowances ([24_trade]). The macro-economic production factors are capital, labor, and final energy.
*' A nested production function with constant elasticity of substitution determines the final energy demand
*' ([01_macro], [29_CES_parameters]). REMIND uses economic output for investments in the macro-economic
*' capital stock as well as for consumption, trade, and energy system expenditures.
*'
*' The macro-economic core and the energy system part are hard-linked via the final energy demand and the
*' costs incurred by the energy system. Economic activity results in demand for final energy in different
*' sectors (transport ([35_transport]), industry ([37_industry]), buildings ([36_buildings])...) and of
*' different type (electric ([32_power]) and non-electric). The primary energy carriers in REMIND include
*' both exhaustible and renewable resources. Exhaustible resources comprise uranium as well as three fossil
*' resources ([31_fossil]), namely coal, oil, and gas. Renewable resources include hydro, wind, solar,
*' geothermal, and biomass ([30_biomass]). More than 50 technologies are available for the conversion of
*' primary energy into secondary energy carriers as well as for the distribution of secondary energy carriers
*' into final energy.
*'
*' The model accounts for the full range of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most of which are
*' represented by source. REMIND simulates emissions from long-lived GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O), short-lived GHGs
*' (CO, NOx, VOC) and aerosols (SO2, BC, OC). It accounts for these emissions with different levels of detail
*' depending on the types and sources of emissions. It calculates CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, CH4
*' emissions from fossil fuel extraction and residential energy use, and N2O emissions from energy supply
*' based on sources.
*'
*' The code is structured in a modular way, with code belonging either to the model's core, or to one of the
*' modules. The folder structure is as follows: at the top level are the folders config, core, modules and
*' scripts. The config folder contains the REMIND settings and configuration information. The core folder
*' contains all the files that are part of the core. The modules folder holds all the files that belong to
*' the modules, with numbered sub-folders for every module. The scripts folder contains helpful scripts for
*' starting a model run and analysing results.
*'
*' REMIND is run by executing the main.gms file, which loads the configuration information and builds the model,
*' by concatenating all necessary files from the core and modules folders into a single file called full.gms.
*' The concatenation process starts with files from the core and continues with files from activated modules,
*' in increasing order of module-number. It observes the following structure:
*'
*' ```
*' SETS
*'
*' DECLARATION    ---> of equations, variables, parameters, and scalars
*'
*' DATAINPUT
*'
*' EQUATIONS
*'
*' PRELOOP        ---> initial calibration of e.g. macroeconomic model
*'
*' LOOP
*'         ---> read gdx

*'
*'
*' The GAMS code follows a Coding Etiquette:
*'
*' #### Naming conventions:
*'
*' * Please put effort into choosing intelligible names
*' * Don't just enumerate existing names: `budget1`/`budget2`, `tradebal1`/`tradebal2` will cause everyone
*' for the next years much more frustration than if you choose names like `emi_budget_G8`/`emi_budget_Mud`,
*' `tradebal_res`/`tradebal_perm`/`tradebal_good`
*' * Explain the abbreviation you designed in the descriptive text (the part with the `" "` behind each
*' parameter/variable/equation declaration). `directteinv` is easier to memorize if you know it means "Direct technology investment"
*' * Within REMIND files: use Capitalization to improve readability. `XpPerm` is more easily translated into
*' "Export of Permits" than `xpperm`, the first part of the name (after the prefix) should describe the type
*' of parameter/variable (e.g. `sh` for share, `cap` for capacity, `prod` for production, `dem` for demand, `cost` for costs)
*'
*' #### Prefixes:
*' Use the following *prefixes*:
*'
*' * "q_" to designate equations,
*' * "v_" to designate variables,
*' * "s_" to designate scalars,
*' * "f_" to designate file parameters (parameters that contain unaltered data read in from input files),
*' * "o_" to designate output parameters (parameters that do not affect the optimization, but are affected by it),
*' * "p_" to designate other parameters (parameters that were derived from "f_" parameters or defined in code),
*' * "c_" to designate config switches (parameters that enable different configuration choices),
*' * "s_FIRSTUNIT_2_SECONDUNIT" to designate a scalar used to convert from the FIRSTUNIT to the SECONDUNIT
*'                              through multiplication, e.g. s_GWh_2_EJ.
*'
*' These prefixes are extended in some cases by a second letter:
*'
*' * "?m_" to designate objects used in the core and in at least one module.
*' * "?00_" to designate objects used in a single module, exclusively, with the 2-digit number corresponding
*'          to the module number.
*'
*' Sets are treated differently: instead of a prefix, sets exclusively used within a module get that module's
*' number added as a suffix. If the set is used in more than one module no suffix is given.
*'
*' The units (e.g., TWa, EJ, GtC, GtCO2, ...) of variables and parameters are documented in the declaration files.
*'
*' For the labels of parameters, scalars and set, use double quotes only.
*'
*' #### Commenting:
*'
*' * Comment all parts of the code generously
*' * For all equations, it should become clear from the comments what part of the equation is supposed to do what
*' * Variables and parameters should be declared along with a descriptive text (use `" "` for descriptive text to avoid compilation errors)
*' * Use three asterisks `***` for comments or `*'` if the comment should show up in the documentation of REMIND
*' * Never use 4 asterisks (reserved for GAMS error messages)
*' * Don't use the string `infes` in comments
*' * Don't use `$+number` combinations, e.g., `$20` (this interferes with GAMS error codes).
*' * Indicate the end of a file by inserting `*** EOF filename.inc ***`
*'
*' #### Sets
*'
*' * Don't use set element names with three capital letters (like `ETS` or `ESR`), otherwise the maglcass R
*' library might interpret this as a region name when reading in GDX data
*'
*'
*' #### Equations:
*' The general idea is not to write code and equations as short as possible, but to write them in a way they
*' can be read and understood as fast as possible. To that end:
*'
*' * Write the mathematical operator (`*`, `/`, `+`, `-`) at the beginning of a line, not the end of the last line
*' * Leave a space before and after `+` and `-` operators and equation signs (`=g=`, `=l=`, `=e=`)
*' * Leave a space behind the comma of a sum (not behind the commas in set element calling)
*' * Use indentations to make the structure more readable
*' * Use full quotes (`"feel"`) instead of single quotes (`'feel'`) when specifying individual elements of
*' a set (this makes automatic replacement via sed easier)
*' * Put the equation sign (`=g=`, `=l=`, `=e=`) in a single line without anything else
*'
*'
*' #### Switches:
*' A switch must be defined in main.gms
*' Follow this mode of definition for parameters, including the indentation:
*' --------
*' parameter
*'   param_name    "explanation what it means"
*' ;
*'   param_name = 0;     !! def = 0  !! regexp = 0|1
*' --------
*' * def shows the default value, which is added only for the user to remember if changed manually
*' * regexp is optional, the value is read by scripts/start/checkFixCfg.R to check the validity of the input.
*' In this case, it checks whether the value fits this regular expression: ^(0|1)$
*' Use 'value1|value2' for specific values, use '[1-7]' for a row of integers.
*' Three shortcut are defined: use 'is.numeric' for numeric values, 'is.nonnegative' for >= 0,
*' and 'is.share' if the value must be >= 0 and <= 1
*'
*'
*' #### Other general rules:
*' * Decompose large model equations into several small equations to enhance readability and model diagnostics
*' * Don't use hard-coded numbers in the equations part of the model
*' * Parameters should not be overwritten in the initialization part of the models. Use if-statements instead.
*' Notable exceptions include parameters that are part a loop iteration, e.g. Negishi weights.
*' * Have your work double-checked! To avoid bugs and problems: If you make major changes to your code, ask an
*' experienced colleague to review the changes before they are pushed to the git main repository.
*' * Use sets and subsets to avoid redundant formulation of code (e.g., for technology groups)
*' * If big data tables are read in exclude them from the `.lst`-file (by using `$offlisting` and `$onlisting`),
*' nevertheless display the parameter afterwards for an easier debugging later
*' * When declaring a parameter/variable/equation always add the sets it is declared for,
*' e.g. `parameter test(x,y);` instead of `parameter test;`
*' * do not set variables for all set entries to zero (if not necessary), as this will blow up memory requirements.
