*' @description
*' This realization implies an endogenous growth path. It replaces and overwrites, respectively, the exogenous SSP GDP growth paths.
*' The spillover module computes new efficiency growth parameters for labor and energy that enter the upper level of the CES production function.
*' The implemented growth engine allows to increase growth by R&D investments into innovation and imitation. It also allows for spillover effects that
*' represent the catch-up with technological frontier. The model implemented as well as its parameetrization is based on Huebler et al. (2012).

*' @limitations
*' This realization was last applied with REMIND version 1.6, but not yet with REMIND2.0. In order to work properly it might be necessary to resolve
*' interference with the calibration and module 29_CES_parameters.
