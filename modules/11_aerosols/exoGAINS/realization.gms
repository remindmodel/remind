*' @description Bundle the air pollution emission results from different sources. We calculate the emissions for sectors that are available in the GAINS model with the interactively run script exoGAINSAirpollutants.R. Land related emissions are taken from MAGPIE. 

*' @limitations EDGE-transport runs in between iterations and is therefore not fully optimized.
