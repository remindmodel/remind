*** LÃ©a to do: technologies still missing are h2 to electricity and "coal to electricity"

*** Keep historical data until 2020 
*** AM the lowbound of solar and pv for 2030 to be taken from the NDCs (in GW), therefore multiplying by 0.001 for TW*
*** NPi bounds are only applied after 2020, as NPi scenarios should always have cm_startyear higher than 2020.
