*** in case of a putty formulation, the model putty_paths will try to 
*** find a pathway of variations which fits approximately the exogenous trajectories
*** the underlying variables (e.g. the consumption of useful energy in the whole buildings stock)
*** may vary but this is very costly in the objective function (we allow for these variations
*** because EDGE does not have a vintage structure and the projections might not fit the putty formulation
