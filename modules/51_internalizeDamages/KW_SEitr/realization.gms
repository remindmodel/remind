*' @description The social cost of carbon corresponding to the Kalkuhl&Wenz (2020) damages including the standard error calculated in module 50_damages/KW_SE is calculated. The analytical approach from Schultes et al (2021) does not work here due to the missing interaction terms in the damage marginals. Therefore this is based on a direct calculation of the SCC as the discounted difference between a GDP path with climate change and a GDP path with climate change and an additional emission pulse (done in 50_damages/KW_SE), following Ricke et al. (2018).
