*' @title CDR
*'
*' @description The 33_CDR module adds further options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere beyond BECCS
*' and afforestation, which are calculated in the core. Currently, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS)
*' and enhanced weathering of rocks (EW) are available, ocean alkalinization (OAE) implemented as ocean liming.
*' All options can be switched on and off individually via the switches called cm_33[option abbreviation].
*' The module calculates capacities, emissions (including captured carbon), energy demand & supply, costs,
*' and limitations associated with the different options.
