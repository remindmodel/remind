*' @description
*' (DACCS) Direct air capture uses heat and electricity to capture CO2 from the atmosphere,
*' which can then either be used or stored. Based on the climeworks technology described in Beutler et al. 2019,
*' we assume 5.28 EJ/Gt C (* 12 Gt C/44 Gt CO2) = 1.44 GJ/tCO2 (*10^6 kJ / GJ * 1h/3600s) =  400 kWh/tCO2
*' electricity and 21.12 EJ/Gt C (* 12 Gt C/44 Gt CO2) = 5,76 GJ/tCO2 (*10^6 kJ / GJ * 1h/3600s) = 1600 kWh/tCO2
*' low-temperature heat demand. The heat can be provided via district heat, electricity, gas, or H2. If gas is used,
*' the resulting CO2 is captured with a capture rate of 90%.
*' (EW) Basalt is mined and ground to fine grain sizes (specified in cm_gs_ew, by default 20 Âµm), and then spread
*' on crop fields where it weathers in reaction with water and atmospheric CO2. Electricity is needed to grind the
*' rocks and diesel is needed for transportation and spreading on crop fields. The weathering process leads to an exponential
*' decay over time of the spread rocks. There is an upper limit on the amount of rock that can be on the fields, so that
*' in equilibrium only the part that decays in one timestep can be replaced in the next. In addition, an arbitrary
*' limit of the amount of rock spread each year can be set in cm_LimRock. Costs consist of costs for capital, O&M,
*' distribution and transport (grades depend on region specific transport distance from mine to fields).
*'
*' Equations for each option determine the capacity, emissions, energy demand, costs and limits.
