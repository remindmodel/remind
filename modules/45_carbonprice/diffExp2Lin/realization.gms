*' @description: This realization implements exponentially increasing carbon price - either until end of century or until peak year (constant or linear thereafter). Optional carbon price differentiation and quadratic phase-in can be activated via switch cm_co2_tax_spread.

***--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** diff: regional prices are initially differentiated by GDP/capita and converge using quadratic phase-in until cm_CO2priceRegConvEndYr (default = 2050), globally uniform price thereafter,
***       level of regional carbon price differentiation (uniform, medium, strong) can be chosen via cm_co2_tax_spread
*** Exp:  carbon price of developed regions increases exponentially with rate given by cm_co2_tax_growth (default = 4.5 percent),
***       initial value in cm_startyear is given by cm_co2_tax_startyear (if iterative_target_adj != 0, this value will be adjusted to meet prescribed CO2 budget)
*** 2Lin: (with iterative_target_adj = 9):  after the peak year (initial value given by cm_peakBudgYr, will be adjusted by algorithm in core/postsolve.gms),
***                                         carbon price of developed countries increases linearly with fixed annual increase given by cm_taxCO2inc_after_peakBudgYr (default = 0, i.e. constant)
***       (with iterative_target_adj = 5):  carbon price of developed countries keeps increasing exponentially until end of century, i.e. no change after peak year
***       (with iterative_target_adj = 0):  after year given by cm_peakBudgYr (default = 2050), carbon price of developed countries increases linearly with fixed annual increase given by cm_taxCO2inc_after_peakBudgYr (default = 0, i.e. constant),
***                                         for exponentially increasing carbon price until end of century, set cm_peakBudgYr = 2110
