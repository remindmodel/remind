*' @title Buildings
*'
*' @description  The 36_buildings module calculates the demand for energy from buildings.
*'
*'               The `simple` realization only gives a representation of the demand for energy carriers.
*'               The `services_with_capital` realization distinguishes between end-uses and adds a trade-off between energy consumption and capital investments.
*'               The `services_putty` realization uses `services_with_capital` as a basis, but adds inertia dynamics to the improvement of building envelopes (insulation).
