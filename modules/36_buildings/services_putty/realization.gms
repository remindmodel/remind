*' @description 
*' 
*'The `services_putty` realization splits the representation of buildings energy demand between the CES structure
*' and a multinomial logit structure which distributes the demand across technologies.
*' Importantly, the realization distinguishes across four end-use categories (`appliances and lighting`, `water heating and cooking`,
*' `space cooling` and `space cooling` ).
*' Not only the demand for final energy is represented, but also the demand for useful energy, which is necessary to display the level of efficiency achieved.
*' In total, six energy carrier categories are included (electricity, solids, liquids, gas, district heating, hydrogen), spread across the various end-uses.
*' 
*' The model can decide to invest in end-use capital (insulation, appliances, space cooling) to reduce the energy demand, 
*' or it can switch to more efficient technologies to produce heat. 
*' The conversion efficiencies of the individual heat technologies is prescribed exogenously however.
*'
*' In addition, inertia dynamics are integrated through a putty-clay representation. 
*' In each time step, the model can only improve the efficiency of a portion of the building stock.
