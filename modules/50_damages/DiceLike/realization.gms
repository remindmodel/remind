*' @description Output damages are calculated based on the DICE-based damage function (see @DICEdocumentation). Multiple different specifications can be chosen: DICE2013R, DICE2016, Howard (@Howard2017) or different options from Kalkuhl & Wenz (2020) (KWcross for the cross-sectional specification, KWpanelPop for the panel specification with population weighting) through the switch cm_damage_DiceLike_specification. They are based on the global mean temperature pathway from MAGICC.

*' @limitations: Unless the realization "DiceLikeItr" is used for module 51_internalizeDamages, the damages are not actually part of the optimization, but just enter as a fixed variable updated in between iterations.
