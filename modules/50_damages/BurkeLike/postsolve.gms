* Damage function based on Burke et al. (2015), extended by finite persistence/adaptation parameterization
* For details refer to Schultes et al. (2021) supplementary material
* time index mapping from supplement to code:  tall = t ; tall2 = t' ; tall3 = t''


*calculate growth rate damages
* TODO for RCPs higher than 26:  Limit too extreme out-of-support extrapolation (No country hotter than X degrees in Burkes data). Not relevant for RCP26.
