*' @description Output damages are calculated based on the damage function from @Burke2015, extended by a finite persistence term. The details are described in @Schultes2020. The persistence is a parameter to be specified in the config file (cm_damages_BurkeLike_persistenceTime). Two different damage realizations can be chosen via the switch cm_damages_BurkeLike_specification. "0" uses the short-run specification without lags, "1" the long-run specification. Damages are calculated on the regional level, the global temperature path from MAGICC is scaled to REMIND regions in module 16_downscaleTemperature, requiring the setting downscaleTemperature=CMIP5. 

*' @limitations: Currently only valid for RCP2.6, as for higher RCPs there is no limit for too extreme out-of-sample extrapoliations in terms of temperature (as it is done in Burke paper). Also the temperature downscaling requires a scaling parameter which is currently only included for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and for SSP2 population. Furthermore, unless the realization "BurkeLikeItr" is used for module 51_internalizeDamages, the damages are not actually part of the optimization, but just enter as a fixed variable reducing output, updated in between iterations.
