*' @description Transport demand composition is calculated based on the EDGE-transport model.
*' This realization allows the EDGE-transport model to interact with REMIND. EDGE is set to run in between iterations. 
*' EDGE runs every 5 iterations, to allow REMIND to stabilize in between. Transport structure is defined in detail in 
*' EDGE, and only aggregate values are then fed to REMIND. The CES transport branch has 2 nodes (passenger and freight 
*' transport) each divided into Short-Medium distance and Long distance options. The CES branch is in energy services units 
*' (passenger or ton km). Bunkers (Shipping and Internaitional Aviation) represent the Long distance CES leaves. Vehicles 
*' capacity addition is calculated in EDGE (REMIND has no vintage tracking).

*' @limitations EDGE-transport runs in between iterations and is therefore not fully optimized.
