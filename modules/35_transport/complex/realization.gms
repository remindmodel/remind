*' @description Transport demand composition is calculated for LDV categories, electric trains and an aggregate category HDV.
*' The CES transport branch has 3 nodes (LDV, HDV and electric trains). LDVs are in turn divided into ICE cars, BEVs, FCEVs.
*' The CES branch is in useful energy units (EJ). A correction for the different efficiency of LDV powertrains is therefore included.
*' HDVs include both passenger and freight modes. Vehicles capacity addition for LDVs is calculated in REMIND.

*' @limitations Not very flexible implementation of new transport alternatives
