*'
*' @description
*' This realization considers imperfections on capital markets represented by constraints
*' (e.g. limits on debt accumulation) and risk mark-ups on capital flows. Moreover, regionally differentiated
*' preference paramters (so-called savings wedges) cover institutional imperfections. Compared to the perfect
*' capital market realization, this realization substantially improves the fit of simulation results (initial 
*' consumption paths and current accounts) with the data.
*'
*' @limitations
*' This implementation ist still under construction.
