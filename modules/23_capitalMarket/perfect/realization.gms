*' @description
*' The perfect capital market realization assumes unrestricted capital mobility and
*' investments decisions that are based on uniform savings behavior (equal time preferences and intertemporal
*' elasticities of substitution) across regions.
*'
*' @limitations
*' The resulting consumption paths and current accounta in initial periods do not fit to empirical data.
*' Energy system dynamics and mitigation costs are hardly affected.
